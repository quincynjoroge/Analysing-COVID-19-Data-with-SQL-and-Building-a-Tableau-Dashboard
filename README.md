## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world, claiming millions of lives and disrupting billions more. As the virus continues to spread, it is essential to understand its patterns and trends in order to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.

Data analysis can help us to make sense of the vast amounts of COVID-19 data available, revealing insights into the pandemic's spread, impact, and potential solutions. Using the powerful tool of SQL, we can explore and manipulate this data to answer critical questions about the virus.

This project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic by conducting a variety of data analyses. We will examine total confirmed cases, daily new deaths, vaccination administration, and more, to reveal the global impact of the virus and highlight successful vaccination campaigns.

Through these analyses, we hope to gain valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on different regions of the world. 

## Implementation
We will use SQL to analyse and derive insights from COVID-19 data. The data for this analysis was sourced from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) page, which collects data from the World Health Organization (WHO). The project focuses on various aspects of the pandemic, including total confirmed cases, daily new deaths, mortality, infection rates etc.

To conduct the analysis, SQL queries were implemented using the SQL server and SQL Server Management Studio. The project leverages the power of SQL to manipulate and aggregate the COVID-19 data, enabling meaningful insights to be derived. Each SQL query addresses a specific question or objective and provides valuable information about the global impact of COVID-19.

## Project Setup:

To set up and replicate the COVID-19 data analysis project, follow these steps:

### Tools and Technologies:

**SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is the primary tool used for data analysis in this project.

**SQL Server Management Studio**: SSMS is the chosen interface to interact with the SQL database management system (DBMS) for executing SQL queries and managing the database.
Database Setup:
